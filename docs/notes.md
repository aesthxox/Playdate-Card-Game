Objective:
- Turn 2
- Clean UI
- More cards
- More functions for the enemy

Clean UI:
- moving the text, make it smaller, etc.
- making boarders around the text
    
    Preni: got rid of the spites to make the UI look better for now but some sprite code is commented out.
        would like to used the animatedSprites libary when the chance arises 
    Preni (11/13): Fixed looping errors and UI is now able to move properly. Visiually more clear.
        -Playerhand text
        -playboard text
